Repository includes solutions for the following challenges:

  1. DFSTraversal.java

  ArrayList<GNode> walkGraph(GNode node)
    - returns an ArrayList containing every GNode in the graph. 
      Each node appears in the ArrayList exactly once (i.e. no duplicates).
  
  ArrayList<ArrayList<GNode>> paths(GNode node)
    - returns a ArrayList of ArrayLists, representing all possible paths through the graph starting at 'node'.
      The ArrayList returned can be thought of as a ArrayList of paths, where each path is represented
      as an ArrayList of GNodes.
      
  2. SimpleWordCounter.java
    - new SimpleWordCounter(fileUrl) - produces a list of word occurences sorted DESC.
